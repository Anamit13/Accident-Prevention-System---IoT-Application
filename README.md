# Accident-Prevention-System---IoT-Application
Many-a-times we see road accidents occurring from different reasons like potholes, high rains, slippery roads, fog, etc. And the number of car accident are increasing by 16% each year which is a big topic of concern. To avoid these road accidents there is a solution which can be fulfilled using IoT technology. In this solution we had made a system which will detect potholes, road slipperiness, rain and fog 1KM before the current location and alert the driver for any danger condition. In this for data collection we had used a cloud platform and mobile notification service for sending the alerts to the driver.

### Problem Background
Many accidents occur on road due to many reasons like fog, wet roads and rain, pat holes, distracted driving, etc. And the number of car accident are increasing by 16% each year which is a big topic of concern. Many people lost their lives in car accidents due to dense fog in which the visibility is less and there comes variation in speed. In rains the roads become very slippery due to which brakes doesnâ€™t work properly and caused car crashes. There are many such reasons but this is the time to fix them.

### Data Analysis
1.	There is a need to think upon road safety. 
2.	Accidents occur due to fog, slippery roads and improper infrastructure.
3.	If there will be a system that can alert user then it will be very helpful.
4.	Illuminated and marked roads in fog and rain.
5.	If the alert could suggest the relevant speed to drive in such conditions.
6.	Infrared vision must become an essential tool for all segments of four wheelers (entry level to premium).

### Scope of the project
The scope of the project is based on real time application. 
1.	The user will get an alert on his/her mobile about the situation of 100m ahead road.
2.	There will be sensors which will detect fog, rain, slippery roads and potholes and give the data to the cloud.
3.	If the range of any condition exceeds then cloud will give an alert to the user.
